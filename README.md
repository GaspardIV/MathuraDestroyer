# MathuraDestroyer

Polish matura (school-leaving exam) is organised by cke. CKE every year announces results and then publish exercises and assessment criteria on their site.

Exercises with the same core curriculum point should be similar, because they are checking the same math skill.

This project is a website generator, that generate a page with exercises from previous years grouped by core cirriculum point, and then sorts groups by their count, so the most popular exercise type is on top.
It should help every math pupil pass his matura exam by learning schemes of exercises.



Exmple result page is avaible here:
