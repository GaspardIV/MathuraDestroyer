# MathuraDestroyer

Polish matura (school-leaving exam) is organised by cke. CKE every year announce results and then publish on their site exercises and assessment criteria.

Exercises in the same core curriculum point should be similar, because they are checking the same math skill.

This project is a website generator, that generate a page with exercises from previous years grouped by core cirriculum point, and then sorted groups by their count, so the most popular exercise type is on top.
It should help every math pupil pass his matura exam by learning schemes of exercises.

Exmple result page is avaible here:
